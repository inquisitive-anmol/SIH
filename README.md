To build a scalable web app that can handle heavy loads with smooth performance, consider the following tech stack:

### Frontend:
1. **React.js**: A highly scalable JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based architecture helps in building reusable UI components.
2. **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). It enhances performance and SEO.
3. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development with custom designs.

### Backend:
1. **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows you to build scalable network applications. It's event-driven, which makes it efficient in handling multiple requests.
2. **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust features for building web and mobile applications.
3. **GraphQL**: An API query language that allows clients to request exactly what they need. It reduces over-fetching and under-fetching of data.
4. **Prisma**: A next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript. It simplifies database access and supports various databases.

### Database:
1. **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database with a strong focus on extensibility and standards compliance.
2. **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It helps in handling high-speed operations and reduces database load.

### Authentication:
1. **Auth0**: A flexible, drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications.

### Deployment & Hosting:
1. **Docker**: Containerization platform that packages applications and their dependencies, ensuring consistency across various environments.
2. **Kubernetes**: An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
3. **Nginx**: A high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy. It can handle a large number of concurrent connections with low memory usage.

### Monitoring & Analytics:
1. **Prometheus**: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit.
2. **Grafana**: A multi-platform open-source analytics and monitoring tool that integrates with Prometheus for data visualization.
3. **Google Analytics**: To monitor user interactions and performance.

### Version Control & CI/CD:
1. **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
2. **Jenkins/GitHub Actions**: For Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

This tech stack provides a balance of scalability, performance, and maintainability, ensuring the web app can handle heavy loads efficiently.
